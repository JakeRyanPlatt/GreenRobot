        <h2>About me</h2>

        <p>My name is Sheila, I also go by <b>Shey</b>. 
            I like to <i>read books, watch lots of shows</i> and go for long walks when the weather is warm. 
            I take my two dogs with me everytime I go somewhere because they like to join me. I finished highschool in <b>2016</b>, and took a year off.
            In <b>2017</b> I went to CCRI in Lincoln, did two years there and kept changing my major. I started with Dental Hygienist and switched to X-Ray on the second year.
            Right before covid, I finished all my pre-requisites and applied for the program itself. Covid hit at the end of <b>2019</b> and beginning of
            <b>2020</b>, where the school had to shutdown and that is where I stopped going and took a long break. After a couple of years my sister told me about
            NEIT and so far I like it.</p>
